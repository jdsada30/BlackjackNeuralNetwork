# Blackjack Neural Network Implementation

This implementation of BlackJack uses 3 Neural Networks. (1st NN decided whether player should draw a 3nd card, 2nd NN decided whether player should draw a 4rd card, 3rd NN decided whether player should draw a 5th card)
It was implemented in Python and uses NumPy Library to handle Matrix math for feedforward and backpropagation training algorithm.
